To make it even more general we need a second parameter so that we can specify whether we want the min or max values. The parameter will default to the min value, thus the **reverse=False** parameter for ascending order, but if what require the max value, then we need to explicitly specify that **reverse=True** for descending order."

Once again, this is merely all conjecture, and even based on incorrect calculations. In our superstitious_births() function returns the sum of births on Friday 13s versus all other Firday births.
