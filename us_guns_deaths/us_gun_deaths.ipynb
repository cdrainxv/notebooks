    "In the last post, there was emphasis placed on how to read in csv file(s), remove the headers, work with the data, and then finally close the file. Today we will look at how to use the **csv** module for python to write and read csv textfiles. That will only be a small extent of today's focus as what we want is to actually work with data that we can make solid and accurate observations upon. For now let's learn how to make use of the **csv** module. Additionally, we will make use of a **context manager** as briefly mentioned at the end of the last post. We will not go into depth into the workings of the csv file as the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples) is very easy to read and has very excellent examples to which we can refer."

Numbers don't generally convince the average person; they will need further either further clarification or a simpler easily digested format. One of these formates could possibly be tables. In the next post we will use a python packages named [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to work better with tabled data in flat files like csv's. Pandas has many awesome features that enable us to perform calculations across our data quite tersely, merge several data files, and manipulate enitire rows and columns amongst other use cases."
